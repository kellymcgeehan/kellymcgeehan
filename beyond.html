    <subheader> personal essay </subheader> 
    <p>1.</p>
    <p>My coach’s absence was, without a doubt, going to affect my race. Walking into my his classroom that morning to drop off my track bag, two minutes past the late bell, and anticipating his disapproving laugh as I entered, I was greeted by nervous silence. An unsupervised class. It was the first time in thirty years school was in session without his presence. </p>
    <p>A few classmates claimed they saw him getting handcuffed outside of the Fresh Stop on their way to school. Others thought his wife had died of sudden illness-she happened to be doing medical missionary work in South America. On four different occasions, the dean brought me into her office, asking if I had anything to tell her. Despite the chaotic rumors spreading throughout the halls, and my gut feeling that something was incredibly wrong, my mind was occupied by, mostly, myself. That night was the Meet of Champions, and we were supposed to discuss my splits for the 800 meter dash. </p>
    <p> 2.</p>
    <p>In defense of my self-absorption, I should modestly note that my athletic career exceeded at times beyond recreation. At six I spent Sundays trekking up Suicide Hill at Belmont Plateau. At twelve Usain Bolt and I ran in the same lane on the same weekend at Franklin Field. Fall, winter, and spring were elusive indications of a year passing: the only seasons I deemed viable were cross country, indoor, and outdoor. And the only tangible sense of time I had were my splits. I was an athlete before a student, a competitor before a teammate, and a runner before I was myself.
    </p>
    <p> 3. </p>
    <p>By the end of the school day reports spread across the county: “Longtime Physics Teacher & Coach Charged With Sexually Assaulting Student.” The article declared that he was “charged with sexual assault for allegedly carrying on a relationship with one of his students.” There are anecdotes from the victim, detailing a night when, on a team trip, he got her drunk to make an advance. “As a teacher and coach,” District Attorney Jack Whelan said, “Gregory Stanczuk flagrantly used his position of trust and authority to exploit the victim, manipulating her emotionally for his own sexual gratification” (“Longtime Physics Teacher & Coach”). 
    </p>
    <p>What the articles failed to mention was that he was Stan, never Stanczuk. They omitted that he was well respected and I spent more time with him than my family. He was the one willing to drive me home after practice, or through a four hour blizzard, only so I could run the worst race of my career. My coach’s reliance was something I never had to question, or so I thought. Once on the team bus, all of the girls huddled to the back and Maddie read aloud news reports and tweets. Some of my teammates were crying. Many of the younger teammates were convinced it couldn’t be true. </p>
    <p> 4.</p>
    <p>There are unspoken rules in the running world. One of them is that truth lives in one’s times. A runner’s times are their most definable feature, treated as the basis of rank. Times created a class system: the great, the good, and the average. If you were average, you flew under the radar, exempt from his rigid expectations. If you were good, or worse, great, it was as if the entire track were coated with eggshells. There seemed to be a fog of anxiety on the track. Each girl feared the next workout, the next expectation, the next new girl. What each teammate feared most was letting him down.</p>
    <p>I was a timid teenager, eager to be validated, to have something to feel proud of. His conditional support seeped into all aspects of my life, convincing me that my self worth too was conditional. Over the years each ribbon, medal, or trophy I collected confirmed one truth: I AM WORTHY, I AM WORTHY, I AM WORTHY. 
    WORTHY (ADJ): HAVING OR SHOWING QUALITIES THAT MERIT 
    RECOGNITION IN A SPECIFIED WAY. The ways in which my teammates and I received recognition were sometimes more subtle than one might expect. I did not expect it past midnight following a Friday night meet when he tossed the keys to his Mustang in my hands and insisted: “You drive.” </p>
    <p>I halted in the vacant parking lot, the offer weighing heavily in my palm. I told him no partly because I had yet to get my drivers license. When he asked if I was sure, ensuring me that it was just machinery, I hurried into the passenger seat and said no again. He shrugged in defeat as if I had just politely declined a date. I did not expect it when he said he preferred my hair blonde, or when my teammates and I spent a week-long beach trip with him unchaperoned for pre-season training.</p>
    <p>5.</p>
    <p>A New York Times article from 1992 declares that “sports psychologists are beginning to understand that there is a unique relationship between the male coach and the young female athlete, and that the delicate balance can sometimes tilt the wrong way” (Bondy). It becomes, for a young female runner, complicated to differentiate her self-worth with her ability to run faster for longer than the girl beside her. It becomes normal to see the thinner and taller girl two strides ahead of you, and assume that if you shed one pound and grow once inch, you will replace her. It becomes commonplace to ramble about workouts and coaches’ expectations with the same anxiety that young girls might talk about school dances and crushes.</p>
    <p>The article then claims, boldly: "Any coach who has been coaching for 10 years and says he never fell in love with an athlete,” John Leonard, director of ASCA, states, “is lying” (Bondy). Initially, I dismissed this statement, like my younger teammates with Stan’s accusations. Then I remembered the evening before the 2014 Indoor States Championships. </p>
    <p>Because what my younger teammates do not remember was when Stan, the varsity 4x1, and I arrived at our hotel the evening before States. I was fifteen and bashful, the youngest of the group. My legs were sore from training with the upperclassmen and I wanted to soak them in the hotel hot tub. I never did, however, because from the pool entrance I caught a glimpse of Stan and my teammate sitting side by side in their bathing suits. Despite my every right to be there, I felt immature and intrusive, as if I had just barged into an older sibling’s room without knocking, and shuffled away before I could be spotted. Later that weekend I overheard that my teammate came back from the pool that night sobbing- and what occurred after I walked away was now stated in the news reports Maddie read aloud to us. 
    </p>
    <p>6.</p>
    <p>I did not cry when the dean informed me, sitting pretzel style on the gym floor, that my coach had sexually assaulted a former teammate. Or when classmates speculated that others too had been assaulted. I did not cry over their accusatory stares in the hallway. Or as I sat on the team bus- reading accounts of something I could have prevented- on my way to represent him. My heart was cold. It made no difference to me if I ever ran another race in my life. The entire county bubbled in rumors and the only people who truly knew him were confined in the yellow prison of the bus, about to exhibit his coaching. I felt betrayed in a uniform that represented a lie.</p>
    <p>The week prior to his arrest Maddie and I were not sitting on the bus but in his car. We were headed to New York City for the Ocean Breeze Invitational or the Marine Corps Holiday Classic Finals at the Armory- the specifics escape my memory now- but what I do remember is asking him what my former teammate was up to nowadays. 
	“Oh I don’t know..” he said. “She doesn’t look well” “Sickly,” he said with a dismissive wave. </p>
    <p>7.</p>
    <p>Jim Loehr, a sports psychologist, notes: “Coaches are often heroes and become idolized and positioned as powerful figures in the lives of young athletes” (Bondy). 
    Reading this, after browsing dozens of articles listing solely the positive effects of athleticism, evoked an “aha” moment. My self-worth, for the entirety of my athleticism, has dangled from the string of my coaches’ stopwatches. As I watched perfection plummet from its pedestal, I felt jipped, like my running career was purposeless: purposeless because it was never mine. I did not know how to run for myself. I ran to avoid inadequacy, to prove my worth. </p>
    <p>In March my worth would be validated, once more, in the form of a college letter. Upon the offer of a full-ride for NCAA cross country and track, the first contact I thought to call was not my mom, or my teammates, but Stan’s. It wasn’t until my thumb hovered over the call button that I remembered he was in a jail cell. I should have been celebrating, but it was finally then, that I cried. </p>
