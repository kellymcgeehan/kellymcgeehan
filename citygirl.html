        <p> new years eve. pours talk </p>
        <p> as boy walks (in. his eyes) </p>
        <p> the room glimmers haunt. </p>
        <p> why is he here,  </p>
        <p> asks girl. </p>
        <p> it's his girlfriend's party, friends say </p>
        <p> hey, don't get bent out of shape. </p>
        <p> the room is ringing.</p>
        <p> i know. he knows i know. i said no,</p>
        <p> thinks girl. </p>
        <p> but no point in telling. </p>
        <p> me, the girl with no proof. that no </p>
        <p> (in his eyes) means promise. </p>
        <p> at midnight the room toasts </p>
        <p> glasses half empty and </p>
        <p> he looks at girl. no, through </p>
        <p> her. like he did in an upstairs</p>
        <p> frat bed while she gave </p>
        <p> cold shoulder. ringing</p>
        <p> in the new year. </p>
        <p> girl hopes he gets a taste</p>
        <p> of his own skin. </p>
