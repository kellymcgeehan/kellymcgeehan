    <p>There was a manhunt for a serial assaulter in South Philadelphia. He attacked</p>
    <p> nine women, on both sides of Broad, biking around night and day, rounding street corners, past our homes, peering about, I bet, for prey. 
    </p>
    <p>I watched the reports obsessively. Because two occurred along my running route. Because I’m an assault survivor. </p>
    <p>Because the word “serial” makes ears perk. Makes news. Makes a tragedy a Netflix trend.</p>
    <p>“Serial” means repeated behavioral patterns. </p>
    <p>To repeatedly intrude a home, a body, and leave unscathed leads an intruder to believe the past is behind them. But memories cannot be boxed. </p>
    <p>In the time a therapist calls my “pre-trauma life” I was in love with a boy, stationed states away. We wrote letters now stored under my bed in a box labeled: BOX 
    </p>
    <p>OF BOYFRIENDS PAST. His are its only artifacts. A shrine I don’t often honor.</p>
    <p>It’s not that I resent public media. It’s that my home is too loud. My home is invaded by satellite. </p>
    <p>On visits we (boy and I) kept a journal: On Hollywood Boulevard I got a stomach ache. In June he said he’d missed me. Then backed into a parked car in Little Tokyo. I remember </p>
    <p>the thump. of trains heading west on Regional Rail. in the days we dreamed of living in “the city.”</p>
    <p>“the” city meaning Philadelphia. “The” is commonly used to refer to a place or thing that is unique. </p>
    <p>For example, the city I dreamed of and the Philadelphia I live in are not the same cities.</p>
    <p>The past still does not taste as the future promised.</p>

    <p>The piece selected here is a unpublished poem titled “a box labeled: box” that I wrote for my poetry class. I am showcasing this piece because I want my portfolio to communicate that I am a promising creative writer, and I believe my poetry best exemplifies this potential. </p> </footer>
