    <h1> Finally, a Girl! </h1>
    <subheader> personal essay </subheader> 
    <p>1.</p>
    <p>McGeehan. Kelly Mac. Kell-bell. Bella. Kelly Kelly. These are the names I’ve accumulated over the years, the last used frequently by relatives on my mom’s side. My mom gave me her maiden name, a five letter sliver of her former self, as my first. As if to solidify that I am hers, then his. A Kelly first, then a McGeehan. </p>
    <p>She always wanted a daughter. At least that’s what the bubble letters in the scrapbook from 1997 declare: “FINALLY, A GIRL!” My brothers were trivial dog ears in her autobiography. Three childbirths and twenty-five years she waited for a daughter, for me. </p>
    <p>2.</p>
    <p>As a little girl, I semi-consciously based my dream self on CAKE’S “Short Skirt/ Long Jacket.” The lyrics that John McCrea sang-spoke absorbed me. I’d sit smugly in my booster seat, imagining an older self “touring the facility and picking up slack,” with heels clanking against tiled floors, wearing red. I wanted to be a girl who got up early and stayed up late. Who was intriguing, yet all business. A girl who wasn’t having it. Maybe I imagined none of these things. But I doubt the future self I did envision was one to dry heave, on the curb at their concert, from too much cheap wine. She’s a girl who knows her limits. Rather, a girl who doesn’t ignore them. </p>

    <p>When I stand in front of a mirror, I am a clone of heart-shaped face and mousy hair. But a closer look would reveal that my mom’s nose is more narrow and pleasant than my bumped and freckled one. She owns more skin than my slimness embodies, and has a meadow for eyes. Even from where I stand, I can see mine are just brown. My dad’s. </p>
    <p>The features that differentiate my mom and I, what make me his, are things I’ve ruthlessly tried to change. Because no young girl wants to look “just like her father.” In middle school, I plucked my thick eyebrows into two, thin check marks. I spent the next two years seemingly frozen in surprise. Around this time, I stopped smiling with teeth, hating how wrinkles invaded the outside corners of my eyes. Then there was the gap in my front teeth, that cost thousands to fix. A permanent retainer still binds them. My orthodontist told me that If it ever pops out, I must seek dental assistance immediately, or my teeth will gap overnight. “Your body,” he explained, “always wants to revert to its natural form.” </p>

    <p>My brother closest to me in age, Justin, calls me calculated. “You’re too put together. It’s scary,” he jokes. He isn’t wrong. I am meticulous to a fault, a walking grocery list of traits that I admire in others. I shop feverishly for the proper ingredients, swap a characteristic deemed unpleasant for a kinder, non-dairy alternative. My personality is a recipe that I concoct, following instructions with haste, then devour. </p>
    <p>In my imagination, for instance, I am confident. I use the train window as a mirror to apply lipstick, leaving the man behind me, who is staring, unacknowledged. Of course this is not what happens. What happens is I notice him and spin around. My scarf engulfs me, hiding my blushed cheeks. It becomes a commute of darted glances. I’m always first to look away. </p>
    <p>	I’m a lousy cook, and the result -- myself, never meets my expectations. </p>
    <p>5.</p>
    <p>Why is it that every compliment a girl receives feels backhanded? Compliment, perhaps, is not the appropriate word. They feel more like jokes that have not properly landed. Dished out with an expiration date. The man beside me on a full flight was gushing about the nonprofit he co-founded, which strives to diversify suburban neighborhoods, until he became so distracted, by the skin showing between my dress and ankle, that he digressed: “You have such long, slender legs.”</p>
    <p>A few weeks earlier a seamstress slowly jabbed pins, one by one, into my sides, while murmuring, “To be tall, thin, and young again.” Though well-intended, I did not feel flattered standing immobile, lanky, and half naked by wide windows as middle school boys passed by. Gawked.</p>
    <p>6.</p> 
    <p>When my fingers graze the items in my closet, I drown in a sea of former selves. I reach, without thinking, for a leather skirt, the one every girl in my friend group had worn at least twice. This skirt made its rounds amongst us like the girls in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, except we were sluttier and remembered less. The memories, like we are now, are scattered. Similarly to how I still, months later, can’t pinpoint what time in the evening I lost my friends at Firefly Festival. The Arctic Monkeys were playing. My being abandoned, dehydrated, and lacking cell service did not concern me. </p>
    <p>7.</p>
    <p>To be a child of divorce means existing in constant transformation. I was a McGeehan on Tuesdays, Thursdays, every other weekend; a Kelly, the remaining time. The Kelly is the artist in me, what draws me to write. We are painters, musicians, innovators, experimenters. Pop Kelly filled my mom’s childhood home not with Picasso prints, but his own paintings, and wooden model airplanes that hung from the ceiling. He was an Airforce engineer and traveled in the eighties; his seven kids stayed home, got into trouble. </p>
    <p>Drugs inhabited the periphery of my childhood, seeping into my consciousness, but from a distance. Growing up, a maternal relative was almost always in jail or rehab. They would be clean, living in a spare bedroom, then not, no longer coming to Christmas brunch. I was aware of this at a young age. A child born into substance abuse, who habitually cups their ears in the midst of adult conversation, is intuitive, quick to take a hint, but pretends not to be. Because my other half, the McGeehan in me, sweeps everything under the rug. This side is Catholic, polite, happy to see you. Always “Good!” And  “How ‘bout you?” </p>
    <p> 8. </p>
    <p>“There’s only two types of women I respect in the world right now,” declared Glennon Doyle in a Man Repeller podcast, “Angry ones, or ones who are in an active coma.” Hearing her say this, while picking clothes off of my floor, tidying to delay the day’s more urgent responsibilities, hearing her say this felt like chatting over coffee with an older friend, who’s two steps ahead of me. Hearing her say this felt like growing up. </p>
    <p> Listening to Glennon, I noted how my perception of growing up has changed, having recently discarded the notion that acting out is antonymous with maturity. I realized this when sitting in a plush velvet chair, situated across my school’s Title IX Coordinator. We were discussing the logistics of reporting an assault. I sat on the seat’s edge, ready to pounce. I may have been snarling. I was out for blood. 
    “But, you should really think on it more before moving forward,” he argued, “Because you look better. Wiser.” He smiled coolly. The room spun.</p>
    <p>Wiser. The title earned when you become schooled in life. The result of learning from failure. Wisdom is the afternoon I returned to the dorms, flustered, from my first interview, and a friend rushed to comfort me. “Now you’ll be more prepared next time!” she assured. </p>
    <p>Wiser. Now that I know what assault is like, I’ll be more prepared for next time. I wanted to spit in his face. I wanted to bark. </p>

    <p>It seems as if the world pretends that women are not, in fact, mammals. Despite the anti-aging products, the waxing that leave us raw, stripping us of our hard-earned womanhood, we expire. Our inner workings battle against time. Our cycles, if uninfluenced by birth control, sync with the moon. How incredible is that? Yet I wonder, how many of us, sit aghast in the bathroom stall, wondering what crime our bodies have just committed? Blood is everywhere. We are in the midst of a murder scene. I look around at the mess I’ve made. Who knew I was capable of that? </p>
    <p>What I am not capable of is casual sex exempt from early afternoon self-loathing. I am not capable of being a morning person. Of being a girl who can reply “write” with nonchalance, when asked at Thanksgiving dinner what it is, exactly, that I plan to do with my major. Instead, I signal that I’m chewing, with a rise of my pointer finger. Move around the mash potatoes in my mouth. Reach for my water. </p>
    <p>10.</p>
    <p>Kelly. My name. My mom. There is a framed photograph, on my nightstand, in the home I refer to as “my Dad’s.” In it, my mom looks my age, twenty-one,  which means she is about eighteen. Her hair is long, mousy, with a light blonde streak framing her face. She lounges on the couch in Pop Kelly’s Florida condo. Flashes a smile with downcast eyes. Appears relaxed. </p>
    <p>She exudes the ease of a girl who has just awoken from a nap. As if forever captured in those brief seconds of disorientation. When you are vulnerable, fleetingly yourself, not sure exactly of where, or who, you are expected to be. Yet. </p>

    <p>The piece selected here is a unpublished personal essay titled “Finally, a Girl!” that I wrote for my creative nonfiction class. I am showcasing this piece because I want my portfolio to communicate that I am a promising creative writer, and I believe my prose exemplifies my ability to write in various forms. </p> </footer>
